How quickly can a network be trained?

I wrote a neural network that takes 5 inputs, has 30 hidden nodes, and spits out 1 output. The, I fluctuated
the number of hidden nodes to see what causes the error to converge to 0 the fastest. Finally, I decided on
30 hidden nodes. Also, I increased the iterations of the training data from 1000 to 5000, and the error converged
to zero in less time. I also tested data from the second entry on the table, and my neural network correctly predicted 
the person to be a democrat.
